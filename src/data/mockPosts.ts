![Pomodoro timer](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1611224923853-80b023f02d71?w=400&h=250&fit=crop)

The Pomodoro Technique was invented by Italian Francesco Cirillo in the 1980s, offering a simple yet powerful time management approach.

### 📋 Implementation Steps

| Step | Duration | Activity |
|------|----------|----------|
| 1️⃣ | 2 minutes | Choose specific task, write down goal |
| 2️⃣ | 25 minutes | Focus work, avoid all distractions |
| 3️⃣ | 5 minutes | Short break, move your body |
| 4️⃣ | - | Repeat cycle, long break after 4 pomodoros |

> **💡 Expert Tip**: Beginners can start with 15-minute intervals and gradually extend to 25 minutes.

![Priority matrix diagram](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1611224923853-80b023f02d71?w=500&h=300&fit=crop)

This four-quadrant framework helps us allocate energy scientifically:

### 🔴 Quadrant I: Urgent & Important
- Crisis management, urgent meetings
- **Strategy**: Act immediately, but analyze root causes

### 🟡 Quadrant II: Important but Not Urgent  
- Long-term planning, skill development
- **Strategy**: Focus investment, prevent problems

### 🔵 Quadrant III: Urgent but Not Important

- **Strategy**: Delegate or handle quickly

### ⚪ Quadrant IV: Neither Urgent nor Important
- Meaningless socializing, entertainment distractions
- **Strategy**: Reduce or eliminate
